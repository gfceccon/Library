# Library Manager System

This is a library manager system that lets you add users and books and then lend these books to the registered users.

The users can be one of three types:
	- Student
	- Teacher
	- Community

Student users can borrow a max of 4 books for 15 days each. Teacher users can borrow a max of 6 books for 60 days each. Community users can borrow a max of 2 books for 15 days each.

In addition, the books can be one of two types:
	- General
	- Text

General books can be borrowed by users of any type. Text books can only be borrowed by Student and Teacher user types.

This application works by letting you simulate the date of the system. When you first start the application, you will be greeted with a "Choose Date" window, in which you must assign some date to go to the Main Window of the program.

Once in the Main Window, there are a couple of options. First, you will see a menu bar where you can Import/Export a CSV file with users, books or loans, and also set a different date for the application.

Below the menu bar, there are three tabs. These are the Users/Books/Loans tabs, and they will let you see everything that is registered on the system as a list, and also search these lists for a specific registry.

Lastly, we have an additional row of buttons, which are used to issue commands to the application. These buttons will let you add and remove users and books, and lend and return books.
Each of these buttons will open a new window when clicked, where you can fill the fields to accomplish the desired task.
